SMA = Supplementary motor area. The amygdala seeds were manually traced in native space, not in MNI standard space, so those do not have corresponding MNI coordinates. So I have used HO atlas to get the MNI Coordinates.

I have ignored such regions as I have reported either the peak coordinate or COG of the cluster.

Rausch et al. analyzed the seed-voxel functional connectivity of multiple amygdaloid subregions as well as entire amygdala. They observed underconnectivity with only sensory input channels of amygdala i.e. Left Superficial (SF) nuclei and Right laterobasal (LB) nuclei with multiple brain regions indicating abnormal socio-perceptual pathways. They also observed both left and right entire amygdala seed to be underconnected with multiple regions of the brain. ,"@article{rausch2016altered,

They tested the effects of SCR on DMN connectivity (realized by taking 2 seeds - PCC, vMPFC) with the whole brain. In addition to these 2 seeds another seed in Insula was taken because of its putative involvement in autonomic and emotional processes in brain. Functional connectivity with the above 3 seeds revealed both over and under conenctivity in ASD individuals. Moreover the SCR was observed to contribute less to DMN connectivity in ASD individuals.","@article{eilam2014abnormal,

Upon independent analysis of 2 groups - Males and females, they observed predominant underconnectivity in ASD males as compared to TD males  whereas over connectivity in female ASD subjects as compared to TD females.","@article{alaerts2016sex,

A total of 68 bilateral ROIs were determined and then  their partial correlations were found with ipsilateral thamamus voxels. Between group analysis revealed  15 ROIs to be under connected and 9 ROIs to be over connected with thalamus. A secondary analysis that they called reverse iFC analysis, they took the significant regions of thalamus as seed and again did seed-voxel based analysis with unilateral temporal lobes to find over connectivity with regions of auditory cortex.","@article{nair2015regional,
